## 🛡️ Ethernaut Smart Contract Security Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) smart contract security challenges by OpenZeppelin. The goal is to deepen my understanding of blockchain security, strengthen my Solidity skills, and gain hands-on experience with real-world vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts.

### 📚 What You'll Find Here

* Solutions to each [Ethernaut level](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) with detailed explanations
* Insights into common smart contract vulnerabilities and attack vectors
* Practical examples of exploiting and securing Ethereum contracts

### 🚀 Purpose

This project serves as a learning resource and portfolio piece to demonstrate proficiency in smart contract security. It’s a great starting point for anyone interested in exploring Ethereum development and vulnerability analysis.
